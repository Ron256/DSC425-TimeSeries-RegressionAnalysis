The dataset we are working on is a subset of hourly Interstate 94 Westbound traffic volume for MN DoT ATR station 301, roughly midway between Minneapolis and St Paul, MN. Hourly weather features and holidays included for impacts on traffic volume. The data set consists of 9 columns and 48,204 observations. Our goal on this project is to explore and analyze the traffic volume series. Also, we would analyze the relationship between other series and the traffic volume time series. Also, each topic started from aggregating hourly data on a daily and weekly basis. 
Therefore, our model will use data in different ways in order to get good fit models. The 
objective of the daily traffic volume series is to get a good fit model to forecast daily traffic 
volume and predict the traffic volume by using percentage of clouds cover.
